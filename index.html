               <h2>Waiki&#772ki&#772</h2>
               <p class="blurbs">Waikiki (in Hawaiian, Waikīkī) is a neighborhood of Honolulu on the south shore of the island of O‘ahu. Waikīkī is most famous for Waikiki Beach, which is almost entirely man-made. In Hawaiian, Waikīkī means 'spouting fresh water', for springs and streams that fed wetlands that once separated Waikiki from the interior. The area was a retreat for Hawaiian royalty in the 1800s who enjoyed surfing there.</p>
               <p>Waikīkī was our homebase for the week. Our AirBnB was a small apartment about a 5 minute walk to Waikīkī Beach. Truly the perfect location as we were able to walk to most of the tourist attractions. 
                  Mike was up early every morning to bodyboard before most of the tourists flocked to the beaches. By mid-morning, beaches and the sidewalks along them on Kalakaua Avenue were bustling with people. 
                  <br> Most days were spent at any one of the multiple beaches in Waikīkī, or wandering around hunting down highly recommended food spots.
                  We found a Groupon for a Lū‘au nearby; definitely something tourists should experience at least once. We also ended up randomly joining a free lomi-lomi (Hawaiian massage) class being given in the middle of one of the malls,
                  and also bringing home our own ukeleles with every intent to learn how to play them (we did learn some basics).<br><br>
                  I don't know if it's the island air or what, but despite all the tourists, Hawaii still feels...<em>idyllic</em>. </p>

               <h2>Diamond Head</h2>
               <p class="blurbs"> Diamond Head is a volcanic ash cone on O‘ahu known to Hawaiians as Le&#772‘ahi. It is estimated to be about 400,000 - 500,000 years old. The interior was home to Fort Ruger, the first U.S. military reservation in Hawaii. Diamond Head was declared a National Natural Landmark in 1968.</p>

               <p>We took a bus early in the morning from Waikīkī to get to the Diamond Head trailhead. The hike itself was relatively easy (1.5 miles round trip), save for some parts with sudden elevation gains. We took a leisurely pace to the top, with a lot of stops for photos along the way. 
                  Once at the top, there were 360&deg; of breathtaking views of Waikīkī, the ocean, Diamond Head Lighthouse and the Diamond Head crater itself. Thre was an elderly gentleman at the top who was in very impressive shape; he said that he did this trail almost every day.
                  After walking back down to the beginning, we enjoyed some well-deserved sno-cones!</p>

               <h2>Hanauma Bay</h2>
               <p class="blurbs"><em>Hanauma Bay is located on the southeast coast of O‘ahu. It is both a Nature Preserve and a Marine Life Conservation District. About 400 species of fish are known to inhabit the bay, as well as an abundance of Green Sea Turtles (known in Hawaiian as 'Honu'). Hanauma Bay is a nursery ground for immature turtles.</em></p>

               <p>Snorkeling in Hanauma Bay was an absolute dream! Mike and I keep a saltwater fish aquarium at home, and it was a lot of fun recognizing many of the fish we came across. There was a particularly curious Christmas Wrasse that followed us for a while.</p>

               <h2>Dole Plantation</h2>
               <p class="blurbs"><em>In 1899, a young Massachusetts native named James Dole used his savings and moved to Honolulu. He eventually purchased a 64-acre homestead in O‘ahu's central plains and eventually chose to grow pineapples. The business grew rapidly as Dole launched ad campaigns in magazines, invested in modern machinery to process the crops, and obtained significant financial backing in order to purchase more land to farm. By 1950, a small fruit stand was erected so that everyone could savor the plantation's tasty fruit. Then, in 1989, a plantation-style home was built to serve as a living museum to James Dole's work and to welcome pineapple lovers from around the globe.</em></p>
                  <p>We stopped by the Dole Plantation just off of the Kamehameha Highway on our way to the North Shore. It was as one would expect for a museum about James Dole and his beginnings. Truly I just wanted to stop by to get some Dole Whip, like from Disneyland!
                     On the grounds were also a number of feral chickens, and some beautiful colorful eucalyptus trees (which I later learned are called Rainbow Eucalyptus).

               <h2>North Shore</h2>
               <p class="blurbs"><em>The North Shore refers to the north-facing coastal area of O‘ahu between Ka‘ena Point and Kahuku. The largest settlement is Hale‘iwa. The area is best known for its massive waves that attract surfers from around the globe, and is considered the surfing mecca of the world.</em></p>
               <p>The vibe at the North Shore area of O‘ahu is a lot more relaxed than in downtown Honolulu. This is where the famous surfing competitions happen, but we were a few months too early.</p>

               <h2>Nu‘uanu Pali Lookout</h2>
               <p class="blurbs"><em>Nu‘uanu Pali is a section of the windward cliff of the Ko‘olau mountain located at the head of Nu‘uanu Valley. It has a panoramic view of the windward (northeast) coast of O‘ahu. It was the site of the Battle of Nu‘uanu, one of the bloodiest battles in Hawaiian history, in which Kamehameha I conquered the island of O‘ahu, bringing it under his rule. There are many superstitions and legends about this area.</em></p>
               <p>The drive to get to the Pali Lookout Point was almost as scenic as the views from the Lookout Point itself. Pali Highway may just be one of my favorite highways in the world.<br>
                  At the Lookout Point, we saw views of the communities on the windward side of O‘ahu. It was actually quite windy up there with rather strong gusts.<br>
                  There were also <em>A LOT</em> of feral chickens. Like, a lot. I think O‘ahu has a feral chicken problem.

               <p class="blurbs"><em>Kailua lies on the windward coast of Kailua Bay. In the Hawaiian language, kailua means "two seas" or "two currents", so named because of the two lagoons in the district, or the two currents which run through Kailua Bay. It is a primarily residential area.</em></p>
               <p>One of my favorite activities during the trip, my husband and I went sea-kayaking to the two protected seabird sanctuaries (Mokulua).</p>
